We spent years crafting web apps with the classic server-side trio: HTML, CSS, and goldy oldy Javascript. Those were the glory days, everything just clicked. The server did its thing, spat out HTML and CSS, and users got a reliable, smooth experience. It was web development utopia, simple, and predictable.

But, you know how it goes. Tech evolved, and the web dev scene got a makeover. Enter client-side rendering — a game-changer. Suddenly, we had dynamic updates, flashy interfaces, the whole shebang. Exciting? Sure. But let's be real, it threw a curveball at the elegance of the old server-side charm.

So, in the midst of this tech evolution, we took a breather. We found ourselves craving the good old days of server-side clarity. HTML and CSS ruling the show, creating pages that didn't just work but were SEO's best friend.

Enter BEXlite — our way of turning back the clock on server-side goodness. It's not just a tech stack; it's a deliberate nod to the roots of web development. BEXlite teams up HTML, CSS, and server-side magic for that seamless rendering we've been missing. It's a bit of heritage mixed with modern mojo.

As we roll out BEXlite to the web dev fam, we're throwing the invite your way. Join us on a throwback journey, where the server's the star again. Let's build apps that not only push tech boundaries but also pay homage to the principles that made the early days of web dev so darn special!

Ah, and here's the secret sauce: BEXlite isn't just nostalgia; it's a mix of the good stuff from the past with some shiny new toys. We've got Bunjs, bringing that dynamic front-end flair. Elysiajs is the trusty sidekick, adding more tricks to our web-building arsenal. HTMX? It's the magic wand, making server-client communication a breeze. And as for BetterSqlite, it's our backstage VIP, handling data with finesse.

So, when we say BEXlite, we're talking about more than a stack. It's a party where Bunjs, Elysiajs, HTMX, and BetterSqlite are the rockstars. Join us in this tech reunion, where we're not just coding. we're crafting an ode to the web's golden days with a sprinkle of modern genius.
